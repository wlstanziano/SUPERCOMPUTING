# Assignment 1 Essay

I am a data science major so it seems like learning about high-performance computing would be exceedingly useful 
at a lot of possible places I might work at in the future. I also really look forward to getting more comfortable 
with computer science fundamentals like using a command-line interface or git. 

I want to leave this class with a comfortable, if basic, understanding of how to use a terminal, with some solid 
experience with using a supercomputers, and I really really want to better understand how to use Git, and how it 
works on a fundamental level.

I just need to make sure I stay on top of the assignments and ask you questions when I have them or just for help 
when I need it.

The folder structure I created (which is just the one given in the assignment instructions) is good for reproducible 
research, because it separates the constituent parts of the repository and clearly defines each individual part and 
where somebody else looking at my repository can find what they are looking for within it.

If we didn’t document our code, other scholars wouldn’t be able to really understand how we got to our findings nor 
how to reproduce them – either to prove our findings correct/incorrect, or to make use of the techniques we used 
to get to our findings in their own work.

Since I started using Linux a couple months ago, I have been slowly but surely (emphasis on slowly) learning the 
ins and outs of a computer that it seems like only messing around with Linux or BIOS can show you. As a result of 
this, I am really hoping that this class with teach me a lot more about using Linux and how Linux works - since you 
are a devout Linux user and that supercomputers, as far as I know, almost always run on Linux.
